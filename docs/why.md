### Goal: To help simplify the deployment to the Commercial Marketplace.

### Technical Deep-dive in publishing solutions to the Commercial Marketplace 

###  As a publisher, what are the different offers in the Commercial Marketplace?  How do I know which one best suits for my application? 
Qualify the right transactable offer type for your solution, with focus on:
- SaaS 
- Azure Application - Managed Application

### Can you walk me through the publishing process for each transactable offer type? 

### What changes do I need to make in my existing application to integrate it as a SaaS/Managed App offer?

### What is metered billing?  How do I configure that for my offer?
