# Azure Application - Managed Application

- Managed Application (aka Manage App) is a type of Azure Application offer plan to publish solution to the commercial marketplace that is transactable, used to deploy solution into the customer's subscription that will be managed by the partner/publisher.
- Solution template plans, on the other hand, are non-transactable in the commercial marketplace but can be used to deploy paid VMs. 
- We will focus on creating and publishign Managed App.
