### Commercial Marketplace - One Cloud Marketplace, Two Storefronts

- Microsoft AppSource surfaces line of business, industry and productivity applications and services that integrate into Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform services.
- Azure Marketplace surfaces category and workload building block applications that IT professionals and developers can use that are built on Azure or used within Azure subscriptions themselves.

### Notes on Storefronts
- Not directly specified by the publisher, decided on offer properties
- For AppSource
  - Credit card only (e.g. no EA)
  - No custom metering
  - No private plans
- Azure Marketplace
  - Requires an Azure subscription
  - Azure subscription, and portal may be daunting for some purchasers (not everyone is technical, think product designers)

### Publisher initial requirements
- Solution should be in production, artifacts should be deployed in the publisher's Azure subscription
- Have signed up as a Microsoft Partner and have the Commercial Marketplace program in the [Partner Center center dashboard](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/dashboard/commercial-marketplace/overview).
